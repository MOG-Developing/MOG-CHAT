## Why use MOG-CHAT?
- MOG-CHAT is a private and instant messenger that doesnâ€™t need the internet or cloud services. It is 100% local, making it a good solution for areas with little or no connectivity. It also serves as a practical means to learn about and develop embedded networking and web technology using inexpensive hardware. MOG-CHAT enables a break from reliance on centralized media by providing a simple and secure means of local communicating.

## MOG-CHAT
- MOG-CHAT converts the ESP32 microcontroller into a standalone Wi-Fi chat server enabled in Access Point (AP) mode, as it creates its own Wi-Fi hotspot without needing any network connection. The system operates as a private local chat system a modern web browser can open, providing a real-time chat platform. The project demonstrates the power of the ESP32 by integrating Wi-Fi networking, embedded web servers, and responsive UI design into an efficient small modular and energy-saving system, which is ideal for experimental, educational, or off-line communication purposes.
